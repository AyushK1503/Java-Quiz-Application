# Java-Quiz-Application
In today’s digital age, quizzes have become an engaging way to educate, entertain, and challenge individuals. With the rise of e-learning, quiz applications have become increasingly popular as a means of assessing knowledge, testing skills, and providing feedback. In this project, we will be exploring the creation of a quiz application using Java Swing and SQLite.

This is the project structure and the required classes

AdminLogin.java - 
This class provides us with the admin login window

AdminPanel.java - 
This class will provide the admin panel functionality of deleting users and questions, viewing all the questions and adding new questions.

DataBase.java -
This class contains the methods related to the database operations, such as adding the question or retrieving the questions etc.

ProfileChooser.java - 
This class provides us with the option of choosing which profile we want to log in. Also this will be our entry point for the application.

Question.java -
We will use this class’s object to store the questions while retrieving them from the database.

Quiz.java - 
This class will provide us with the quiz window and its gui along with the timer and the next questions logic.

Register.java - 
This class will register new users and add them to the database.

UserLogin.java - 
Same as the AdminLogin but for the Users.
